</head>
<body>
    <h1>What does this Privacy Policy Cover?</h1>

    <p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) covers interactions in the course of our “Service” including (a) the website we operate currently located at www.FastAPI-HTTP.com, (b) FastAPI-HTTP’s data analytics services, and (c) unless they are accompanied by a separate privacy policy, other web sites, embeddable widgets (such as customer service “chat now” widgets), downloadable software, mobile applications including tablet computer applications, and messages such as emails that we may send to or receive from you. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to FastAPI-HTTP’s Terms of Service (the “Terms”). References to your “computer” or “device” in the Privacy Policy refer to any device(s) you use to access the Service, and “you” and “your” refer to the individual or entity that has agreed to the Terms.</p>
    <p>By using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do so, we will update the “Last Updated” date above. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.</p>

    <h1>Data Collection, Use, Disclosure, and Security</h1>

    <h1>What type of Data do we collect?</h1>
    
    <p></p>In accordance with this Privacy Policy, the information we collect from you when you use the Service includes:
    
    <p>Submitted Business Information: To help our customers analyze legal spend and detect and prevent excessive or abusive billing practices, we collect and analyze legal vendor invoices, billing statements, and other information submitted by our customers or their vendors. Invoices often contain highly confidential and private information including information related to potential acquisitions, debt, patents, customers, vendors, and other business activities. This information also includes personal and business information related to our customers’ legal vendors and employees including, without limitation, vendor names, addresses, phone numbers, timekeeper name, title, bill rates, dates of service, hours worked, and descriptions of work. See below for policy specific to disclosure of Submitted Business Information.</p>
    <p>User-Provided Information: FastAPI-HTTP may ask you to provide information, including a first name, last name, phone number, and email address, which may be considered “personally identifiable information” (that is, information that would allow FastAPI-HTTP to directly identify a person). You may also provide other personally identifiable information to FastAPI-HTTP when you send an email to FastAPI-HTTP or at other times when you use or access the Service.</p>
    <p>Automatically Collected Information: When you use or access the Service, FastAPI-HTTP may automatically record certain information about or related to your use of the Service that is made available through your computer such as an IP address, information about your computer and software, links, images, or other materials you request, information that may enable FastAPI-HTTP to approximate your location, the pages or screens you accessed on the Service, the dates and times you access the Service, and other information about how you use the Service. This information is collected through the use of different types of technologies, such as standard log files, cookies, and web beacons (sometimes called “clear GIFs”).</p>
    <p>Cookies Information: One form of “automatically collected” information we may record is information stored by “cookies” – small text files containing characters. When you access the Service, FastAPI-HTTP may send one or more cookies to your computer. By sending you cookies with values that are unique, FastAPI-HTTP may be able to uniquely identify your web browser or device when you access the Service. You may review the “Help” file for your computer or web browser to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.</p>
    <p>Web Beacons: Web beacons, which are sometimes referred to as “clear gifs,” are a way of referring to web links that your browser, device, or email program requests when loading a web page, html email, or similar web-connected content. When this request is made, the entity which controls the requested link (which would be FastAPI-HTTP for links back to the Service) can determine if you opened an email containing a web beacon or otherwise viewed particular content.</p>
    <h1>How do we use the Data we collect?</h1>
    
    <p>FastAPI-HTTP may use the information you provide or that FastAPI-HTTP collects (“Raw Data”) to develop, operate, support, maintain, enhance, and provide the Service, to analyze and develop our Service, for marketing efforts, to develop new products and services, and for other administrative and operational purposes, for example:</p>

    <p>to contact you for feedback about the Service,</p>
    <p>to conduct research about the Service,</p>
    <p>to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external purposes,</p>
    <p>to notify you of technical updates or changes in policy, or</p>
    <p>to contact you for marketing and promotional purposes.</p>
    <p>You can opt-out of receiving certain communications, but FastAPI-HTTP reserves the right to continue to send you certain communications relating to the Service, such as service announcements and administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.</p>
    <p>FastAPI-HTTP does not claim an ownership right in Raw Data. We may use Raw Data for our internal business purposes in operating, developing, enhancing, maintaining, supporting, and providing the Service and our other products and services, including to other customers. At no point do we disclose Raw Data to other customers. See below for our policy specific to disclosure of Submitted Business Information.</p>
    <p>All Derived Data and Analytical Results (each as defined below) that we generate through or in connection with the Service using Raw Data, whether alone or in combination with data from other sources, are and will remain our property and may be used and disclosed by us in our discretion.</p>

    <h1>International Users</h1>

    <p>If you use the Service from other regions of the world, you understand and consent to the transfer of information outside of those jurisdictions to the United States or other jurisdictions for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
